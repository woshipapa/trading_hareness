"""Persistence and new-candidate detection for xiaojie leader-flow observations.

A candidate that keeps its setup for an hour is one observation with a widening
window, not one row per 30-second scan.  Collapsing on (session, symbol, mode)
keeps a day's research readable and, more usefully, makes "this is new" a
property of the insert itself: only a row that did not exist before is a fresh
signal, and only a fresh signal is worth interrupting a human for.
