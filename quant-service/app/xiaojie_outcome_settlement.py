"""Settle xiaojie leader-flow observations against what actually happened.

Accumulating observations is only worth doing if each one eventually gets an
outcome attached. This computes them from the canonical daily bars once a
session closes, so a week of running produces an evaluable record rather than
a pile of entry snapshots.

Three returns are recorded because they answer different questions and the
first live session showed they disagree sharply:

``session_return_pct``        entry price to that session's close - what the
                              flag was marked at on the day it fired.  Under
                              T+1 a buy cannot be sold that day, so this is a
                              mark, not a return anyone realised.
``entry_to_next_close_pct``   entry price to the next session's close - the
                              earliest sale T+1 allows, so the first return an
                              account that took the flag could realise.
``next_open_to_close_pct``    the next session's open to its close.  Also a
                              same-day round trip, so not realisable either;
                              kept as a read on the following session's tape.
                              (It was once described as the only earnable one;
                              that overlooked T+1.)

``sealed_at_entry`` is carried as its own column because it decides whether a
row is evaluable. On 2026-08-27, of 111 observations the 63 flagged while
already sealed produced 0 gains, 58 unchanged and 5 losses; the 48 flagged
unsealed averaged +0.78%. Averaging the two together halves every mode's
apparent edge and hides the real defect, which is flagging too late rather
than choosing wrongly.

The benchmark is the same session's cross-sectional median return, so a mode
is credited with what it added rather than with the market it rode.

Every return is also recorded net of a round trip.  Gross was misleading at
the size of edge these modes produce: on 2026-08-27 ``supplement_rotation``
settled at +0.36% gross against a +0.53% market median, and the round trip
(0.26% then, about 0.21% at the 2023 stamp duty) is the difference between a marginal positive and a clear negative.  A
scorecard that only reports gross will keep recommending strategies that lose
money after costs.
