"""Shared liquidity/tradability screen for cross-strategy candidates.

No selection module in this codebase filtered on liquidity before this: a
candidate with a tiny 20-day median turnover, a sub-3 yuan price, a brand-new
listing or an ST flag could rank at the top of a strategy's score with no
signal that a real position could not actually be built or exited without
material market impact.  This is a flag, not a silent drop: a candidate that
fails the screen is still recorded (``liquidity_eligible=false`` plus the
specific reasons) so research can see what was excluded and why, rather than
a candidate quietly disappearing from the ledger.

The thresholds below are deliberately conservative, round-number liquidity
floors (not fitted to any strategy's historical returns) chosen only to
exclude the extreme illiquid tail; they are not a claim that stocks just
above the floor are safely tradable at any position size.
