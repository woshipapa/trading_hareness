"""Point-in-time indicator construction for xiaojie-leader-flow-v1.

The strategy module is a pure decision function over a snapshot of named
fields.  Nothing produced those fields from live data, so it could only ever be
called by hand with values a human typed.  This module builds them from
evidence the intraday scan already holds.

The critical enabler is that the licensed all-A cross-section fetched by every
scan carries far more than the price we were using: ``open_price``,
``high_price``, ``low_price``, ``prev_price``, cumulative ``volume`` and
``turnover``, for all ~5,500 symbols, every 30 seconds.  From that alone the
session VWAP (turnover/volume), the drawdown from the session high, and every
limit-board state are computable without a single extra provider call.

Scope is deliberately the leader pool - names at or near their limit - rather
than the whole market.  That is the playbook's own domain, it keeps the
per-scan cost bounded on a two-core edge box, and it matches the only
conditional base rate that matters for this strategy: a name that was limit-up
yesterday hit the limit again the next session 18.57% of the time on
2026-08-26, against a 0.94% market-wide rate.

What this module does *not* do: it never decides.  It assembles inputs and
hands them to ``xiaojie_leader_flow.evaluate_snapshot``, which remains the sole
place a decision is made and remains research-only.
