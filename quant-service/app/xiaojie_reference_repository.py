"""Session-scoped reference data for xiaojie leader-flow indicators.

Everything here is end-of-previous-session material - limit prices, the prior
bar, a 20-day high, MA5, sector membership - so it is read once per trading
date and reused by every 30-second scan rather than re-queried each time.

Point-in-time discipline: every read is bounded to sessions strictly before
the scan's own trading date.  Today's bars land in the same tables after the
close, and an intraday indicator that silently started using them would be
reading its own outcome.
