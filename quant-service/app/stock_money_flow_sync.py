"""End-of-day per-stock capital flow ingestion.

Sector-level flow was already ingested (``ths_sector_flows``), but nothing in
this codebase ever stored *per-stock* capital flow.  The only per-stock flow
number available anywhere was ``main_net_inflow`` scraped live from a public
Eastmoney endpoint during the intraday scan - a research-only value that is
discarded once the scan ends, so no post-close study could ask whether main
flow preceded anything.

Three independent end-of-day cross-sections are stored, deliberately kept
apart rather than merged, because each vendor defines "main"/"large" order
buckets differently and averaging them would invent a number none of them
published:

``moneyflow``      exchange-derived buy/sell volume and amount by order size
``moneyflow_dc``   Eastmoney's net amount plus super-large/large/medium/small
                   buckets and their percentage rates
``moneyflow_ths``  THS's equivalent decomposition

Boundary, stated plainly: **every one of these is end-of-day only**.  Probed
against the ProMax gateway during the 2026-08-26 session, all three returned
zero rows for that same day while returning full cross-sections (5546 / 6000 /
5210 rows) for the prior session.  So this closes the *research* gap - main
flow is now queryable for post-close and backtest work - and does not close
the intraday one.  ``signal_rules``'s live ``main_net_inflow`` still has no
licensed intraday source, and nothing here should be read as providing one.
