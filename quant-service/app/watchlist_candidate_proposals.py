"""Daily cross-strategy watchlist proposals, deliberately kept out of the live watchlist.

The only real bridge between selection and timing in this codebase is manual:
a human PUTs a symbol into ``intraday_watchlists`` via the API. That table
also has a hard, previously-verified 40-symbol capacity bound tied to the
Tencent batched-quote request size the live intraday scan can make in one
call - a human-curated watchlist already uses most of it (37/40 at the time
this module was written). Auto-writing candidates into that table would risk
pushing the live scan over its capacity and starving real alerting.

This module instead materializes a separate, read-only daily proposal list
from two independent producers, tagged by ``proposal_source``:

``strategy_ledger``      liquidity-eligible candidates from the unified
                         strategy_daily_candidates ledger, ranked by percentile
                         *within* their own strategy_key (their raw scores are
                         not on the same scale - see
                         strategy_daily_candidate_ledger.py's score_scale
                         field) and deduplicated to the single best-ranked
                         strategy per symbol.
``limit_up_continuation``  names that closed locked at the upper limit on the
                         prior session - the densest forward universe measured
                         here (20.20% touch the limit again against a 1.58%
                         market rate) and explicitly not an entry signal, since
                         the open-to-close edge is absent.  See
                         limit_up_continuation.py.
``disclosure_day_watch`` names whose report is registered for the next session
                         and that carry no prior guidance - a scheduled
                         catalyst rather than a scored candidate, so these rows
                         have no raw_score or percentile at all.  See
                         disclosure_day_watch.py for the event study.

A symbol produced by both keeps its scored ledger row, with the disclosure
evidence merged in, because a score plus a catalyst is strictly more
informative than the catalyst alone.

It never touches intraday_watchlists; a human still decides what actually goes
live.
