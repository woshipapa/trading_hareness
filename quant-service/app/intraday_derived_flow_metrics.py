"""Derive watch volume ratio and turnover rate from the licensed THS snapshot.

``signal_rules`` needs three public flow fields together (``volume_ratio``,
``turnover_rate``, ``main_net_inflow``).  All three arrive from one public,
unauthenticated Eastmoney ``ulist.np`` request, which fails roughly half of the
30-second scans observed on 2026-08-26 (``public HTTP GET request failed after
bounded retry``, upstream ``Server disconnected without sending a response``),
and whose bounded basket is not a cross-section - so the rule engine has to
treat every one of its values as research corroboration only.

Two of those three fields are *definitions* rather than proprietary vendor
measurements:

    turnover_rate = cumulative_volume_shares / float_shares * 100
    volume_ratio  = (cumulative_volume_shares / elapsed_session_minutes)
                    / (mean_recent_daily_volume_shares / SESSION_MINUTES)

Every input already exists locally.  The licensed Fuyao/THS
``a_share_prices_snapshot`` fetched by every scan carries cumulative volume in
shares for the whole A-share cross-section, and float shares plus trailing
daily volumes are persisted in ``quant.daily_fundamentals`` and
``quant.canonical_bars_daily``.  Deriving both fields therefore adds no
provider call at all, and unlike the Eastmoney basket it inherits the all-A
cross-sectional scope of the snapshot it is computed from.

``main_net_inflow`` has no THS equivalent and this module never invents one.
The official 59-route REST contract pinned in ``fuyao_catalog`` documents no
fund-flow route and states that minute bars, tick and Level-2 are out of
scope; the Eastmoney ``f62`` aggregation stays that field's only source, and
therefore its only failure mode as well.

Accuracy measured against complete live 36-symbol Eastmoney responses on
2026-08-26.  At 11:08 CST: turnover_rate median absolute error 0.08% (max
2.11%, on names whose persisted float share predates a recent share change),
volume_ratio median 1.15% (max 1.57%).  Through the full capture path at
11:34 CST: turnover_rate 0.08% median / 2.17% max, volume_ratio 0.19% median
/ 0.45% max - the volume_ratio residual shrinks as the elapsed-minute
denominator grows, which is the signature of a sub-minute difference in when
each side starts counting the session, not of a different formula.
:func:`derived_flow_divergence` recomputes exactly that comparison on every
scan where both sources answer, so the agreement is monitored continuously
rather than asserted once.
