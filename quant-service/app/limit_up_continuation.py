"""Prior-session limit-up names as a watchlist universe source.

This is the densest forward-looking universe available anywhere in this
system, and it is deliberately *not* an entry signal.  Both halves of that
sentence are measured, over 156 sessions and 852,380 symbol-days from
2026-01-01 to 2026-08-25.

Density - close-to-close, which is what a naive study reports:

    set                          n        next-day limit-up   next-day return
    whole market            852,380                   1.58%           -0.015%
    limit-up yesterday       13,537                  20.20%           +1.648%
    one-word board            839                    61.50%           +5.388%

A 12.8x and 38.9x lift looks like an edge.  It is not a tradable one, because
that return is realised between yesterday's close and today's close and the
entry it assumes is unavailable:

    set                    open already locked      buyable    open->close
    limit-up yesterday                   8.23%       12,423        +0.006%
    one-word board                      55.42%          374        -0.689%

A one-word board opens locked at the limit more than half the time - there is
no fill - and on the days it can be bought it loses 0.689% from open to close.
The whole gross number lives in the overnight gap.  Even the close-to-close
figure overstates what was achievable, since buying at a limit-locked close is
itself usually impossible.

So this module proposes a universe, not a trade.  Its value is that 20% of
these names touch the limit again, which is where intraday timing rules have
something to work with - and today the 36-name watchlist caught none of the 52
names that limit-up'd (2026-08-26), nor any of the top ten market movers.
Whether an intraday entry inside this universe beats the open is untested:
that needs minute history this deployment does not yet have.
