"""Materialize the daily short-term sentiment reading from closed daily bars.

``sentiment_cycle`` holds the arithmetic as pure functions; this reads the
sessions they need and writes one row per trading day, the same shape
``market_regime_daily`` uses for the index classifier.

The ladder height needs several prior sessions, so this loads a short window
ending on the requested date rather than that date alone.  Instruments without
a listing date are excluded: indices carry no limit price and would otherwise
be counted as names that failed to reach one.
