"""Durable, dependency-injected post-close strategy scheduler.

The scheduler owns only time-window and same-exchange-date semantics.  Data
access, strategy execution and persistence stay behind callbacks supplied by
the composition root.  This makes the important invariant testable without a
database or provider: an older completed run can never make today's scheduler
claim completion.
