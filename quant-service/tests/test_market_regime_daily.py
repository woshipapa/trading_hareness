"""Real-PostgreSQL coverage for persisted daily market-regime classification.

Uses the four benchmark indices' already-ingested history (no synthetic
fixture): the classification for a fixed historical trading date is
deterministic, so this both proves the write path and pins today's actual
regime read for that date.
