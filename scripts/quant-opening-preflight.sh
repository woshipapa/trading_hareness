Usage: scripts/quant-opening-preflight.sh [--skip-backup]

Checks only the local control plane. It does not refresh quotes, fetch market
data, or issue an alert. A recent (< 30 hours) daily PostgreSQL/workflow
backup is required unless --skip-backup is given. The newest archive must
also have a matching ``pg_restore -l`` manifest and parseable workflow JSON.
Completed daily archives must remain within ``QUANT_BACKUP_MAX_BYTES``.
The normal check also performs a non-mutating capacity preview for the next
daily archive.
